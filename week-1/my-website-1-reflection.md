Describe what open source means.
People will use the term for all kinds of meanings. Open soruce means you can see, edit and distribute the software.


What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source is amazing. Security through obscurity is not security at all. So with open source hanging everything out it allows people to help make things better. For example I created a bash fix and someone added a fix to the fix because he used a diffrent setting then me. I would have never known it was a problem because my settings are fine.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
A licenses is a set up rules you aggree to when you use someone's software or code. These are very important. No all software is amazing as Open soruce. Even uncompiling some software can put you in prison. For example you take a program like Windows word and decompile it and fix a bug and send the update code to Microsoft. They are more likly to sue you then give you a thanks. Google on the other hand will give you cash for finding a bug.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It was just good to get more work with git and subl.
