<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was fun. Took a few mins and I am still not sure I did it "right" or the best way

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was good. I am still researching it.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I dont know. Ok I guess but I am sure we did something wrong and I will look back on it 2 years from now and laugh. Or maybe 2 weeks.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seams good at tiering data but it is really bad at reading. To me it seams to be organized is a odd way. I Am sure once I get the hang of reading it it will be fine.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
google. Also I copy and paste a few examples into The code.

Like this


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">A Message</a></li>
  </ul>

</body>
</html>

I will add this to a snippit later.
