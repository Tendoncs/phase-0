You can add them using a name (for common names), Hex, or RGB values.

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
What folder it is in and permissions to the files and directories.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
Tricks? None really. I used chrome dev tools. It was not hard; it just took some time.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
font-Size both px and em., font-family. Color. Position. Border size. Paddings.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We used classes. Elements can have more than one class but only one ID. Also, you can only have one ID on a page - they have to be unique. Classes can be used on many elements.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Our code looked cleaner than the real site. I am not sure which followed best practices. I think ours might have drifted a little off the path on best practices.
