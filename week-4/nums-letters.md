Integer will round the number.
Float will not.

The example of a movie costing $3 and you have $7 how many movies can you see. Is a good example. You can see 2 movies not 2.5 movies.


Question: What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Answer: Is a set up chars. You use them to do inputs and outputs for the most part. Using them as inputs is an issue. It is a great way to break your code. For example if on this project it asked for a number and you put in four it would break if you wanted them to put in 4. Cant do four + 2.


Question: What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Answer: Local veriable are ones only for thw file or program to use. Use them for everything. Use them to take in user input or to move things around your program.
