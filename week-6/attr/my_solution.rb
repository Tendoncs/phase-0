#question:


#question: What are these methods doing?
#answer: They are assigning or printing properties of class profile.
#question: How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
#answer: by calling into the method with an input to change the class variables. Or by asking for the instance variables.


#question: What changed between the last release and this release?
#answer: change things around with commits and added a symbol changed names of methods.
#question: What was replaced? did some research it removed a get/set and placed it.
#answer:nothing really just names of things.
#question: Is this code simpler than the last? did some research it removed a get/set and placed it.

#question:What is a reader method? it reads you a @variable
#question:What is a writer method? it writes to a class @variable
#question:What do the attr methods do for you? they create a variable and the get and set all in one
#question:Should you always use an accessor to cover your bases? Why or why not? not always you might want things to be taken into account when you set or get something.
#question:What is confusing to you about these methods? how a symbol has data linked to it.
